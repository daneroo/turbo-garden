# Nextra

The original scaffold for this monorepo had this site (`apps/docs`) as a simple Next.js app.
We've since enhanced it to use [Nextra](https://nextra.site/)

As noted in the [Components](#components) section below,
we were unable to use the shared library (`ui`) for a component with state (that uses Hooks).

## Setup

Follwing the documentation on the Nextra site, for the [Docs Theme](https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/start)

- Install required packages: `pnpm i nextra nextra-theme-docs`
- Modified the `next.config.js` file to include the `nextra` plugin
  - Added `latex: true` for Math.
- Created the `theme.config.tsx` file, including basice site parameters and logo

## Nextra Feature Deomnstration

Below we demonstrate the use of different Nextra features.

import { useState } from "react";

export function LocalCounter({ children }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      {children}
      {count}
    </button>
